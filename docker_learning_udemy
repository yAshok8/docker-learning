1. command: `docker run <image_name> <command>` => the command will override the default command of image.
2. docker ps
3. container lifecycle => docker run = docker create + docker start
  a. create a container
  b. run the container
  c. container starts and exits. We can restart the exited container with `docker start container_id` command.

  docker system prune => All stopped container and cached containers.
  Get the logs from the container in the real time: docker log <container_id>. This will print the logs of the container no matter what is the state of the container.
  Stopping a running container: We can use docker stop or kill command. Docker stop issues SIGTERM signal. 
  Where as docker kill issues SIGKILL signal to the running processes inside the container.
  
  Home Work: Run a container for docker run busybox ping google.com and try killing that using STOP and KILL commands of docker. Note down the observation.

  docker exec: command to interact with any container.
  docker exec -it <container_id> <command_to_exec> 
  Significance of -it is it will make you interact with container only by being inside the container on current terminal.
  If you wont provide -it flag, the command will exit immediately. You will be kicked back to external terminal.
