1. command: `docker run <image_name> <command>` => the command will override the default command of image.
2. docker ps: all running containers
3. container lifecycle => docker run = docker create + docker start
  a. create a container
  b. run the container
  c. container starts and exits. We can restart the exited container with `docker start container_id` command.

  docker system prune => All stopped container and cached containers will be removed.
  Get the logs from the container in the real time: docker log <container_id>. This will print the logs of
  the container no matter what is the state of the container.
  Stopping a running container: We can use docker stop or kill command. Docker stop issues SIGTERM signal. 
  Where as docker kill issues SIGKILL signal to the running processes inside the container.
  
  Home Work: Run a container for docker run busybox ping google.com and try killing that using STOP and KILL
  commands of docker.
  Note down the observation.

  docker exec: command to interact with any container.
  docker exec -it <container_id> <command_to_exec> 
  Significance of -it is it will make you interact with container only by being inside the container on current terminal.
  If you wont provide -it flag, the command will exit immediately. You will be kicked back to external terminal.

  Command: `docker build .`
  Dockerfile: Writing a dockerfile means telling an empty computer which has nothing to install a software.
  Instructions: FROM, RUN, CMD.
  a. FROM: The docker server will make use of this instruction to fetch a base software to build that image.
  b. RUN: after the first step, this instruction will RUN a command on that image.

  docker run command takes file system snapshot from docker image and copies the same in the newly created
  container created for that image and run the program from that snapshot.

  An image is FS Snapshot + startup command.

  `docker run image_name`: this command runs the image in a container with default startup command.
  `docker run image_name <command>`: this will override the default startup command.
